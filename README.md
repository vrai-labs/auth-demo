# Demo

This demo demonstrates the behaviour of SuperTokens session management solution in case of auth token theft.

This project uses [supertokens-node-mysql-ref-jwt](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node-mysql-ref-jwt) and [supertokens-website](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-website) packages for implementing sessions.

You can access the demo via: http://supertokens.io/ (Only works on Firefox)

NOTE:
- We use http for this demo and send cookies with secure false. But in an actual production system, you should use https and secure true
- The access token expiry time is 10 seconds for the purpose of this demo, but in a production system, you should set it to at least 15 mins.
